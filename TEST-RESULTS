*Testing arithmetic operations with positive numbers:

"+" -  2+3=5.0
"-" -  4-2=2.0
"*" -  5*8=40.0
"/" -  8/4=2.0

*Testing arithmetic operations with combination of positive and negative numbers:

"+" -  -9+6=-3.0
"-" -  -9-7=-16.0
'*' -  -6*10=-60.0
"/" -  -10/5=-2.0

Using integers(positive and negative) returns numbers with one decimal point.


*Testing arithmetic operations with positive/negative numbers and parentheses:

"+" - (-8)+(-6)= ERROR
"-" - -10-5=-15
"*" - 4*(-6)= ERROR
"/" - (-24)/(-2)= ERROR

The user is unable to add, multiply and divide two negative numbers due to the inability of using parentheses.
When the user uses parenteses the program will print "ERROR" on the output.

*Testing of arithmetic operation priority:

When testing many possible combinations, calculator didn't make any mistakes and performed all operations in correct order.

*Testing arithmetic operations with decimal numbers:

When using decimal numbers and the result is negative (with value less then 1) the program prints
the result with unexpected/incorrect rest

for example: 2-2.1= -0.099999905 (instead of -0.9)


*Testing arithmetic operations with decimal numbers(where we have 2 numbers and the second number is inverted version of the first one) :

The program prints a result with an approximate value.

for example : 1.3*3.1=4.0299997 (instead of 4.03)

*Testing arithmetic operations with incorrect input:

examples:
four plus four = "ERROR"
9++3 = "ERROR"
4=0 - "ERROR"

All these results are as expected since Calclator does not allow these kind of inputs. When using ',' instead of '.' the program prints "ERROR" on the output

Testing the calculator by dividing by zero:

-5/0 = -Infinity
4/0 = Infinity
0/0 = NaN
