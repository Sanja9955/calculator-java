CALCULATOR FILE:

- Line 4 - Code Smell (Major) - Class 'Calculator' shouldn't be Public
- Line 18 - Code Smell (Blocker) - Rename method "ToString" to prevent any misunderstanding/clash with method
            "toString" defined in superclass "java.lang.Object"
- Line 24 - Code Smell (Minor) - Method 'Run' should be renamed to comply with a naming convention
- Line 70 - Code Smell (Minor) - Immediately return this expression instead of assigning it 
            to the temporary variable "textResult"
          - Declaring a variable only to immediately return or throw it, is considered a bad practice
- Line 74 - Code Smell (Minor) - Method 'Calculate' should comply with a naming convention 
- Line 183 - Code Smell (Minor) - 'Return' is considered redundant and should be erased

START FILE:

- Line 6 - Code Smell (Minor) - Rename variable 'Expression' to comply with a naming convention 
- Line 8/19 - Code Smell (Major) - System.out should be replaced by a logger
